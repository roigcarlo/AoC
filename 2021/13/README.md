# Transparent Origami #

## Featuring... Curses! ##

F..k!
D.....s!
M....!

No! not those curses, the other curses. 
`curses` can be used to create user interfaces in terminal. I didn't want to translate the final result into a series of chars (did anyone do the conversion?), so I used `curses` to display it.

I also added a touch of color.

Go go, test it out!
