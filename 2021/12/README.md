## Featuring... DFS! ##

I love this algorithm! Specially when you have to implement it over distributed data in memory. Lovely `mpi` implementation but can't show you that code because it was a commercial project :sweat: (tip: multigrid)

I suppose it could have been solved by BFS, but the code run fast!
