## Featuring... Dynamic Programing! ##

Not gonna lie, I spent all day doing this.
It is uses dynamic programing to create a fake vector of socres that I can traverse in socring order of flooding.
Probably it can be optimized removing inseets that appear higher in the dynamic list but not gonna do it.

First problem is wrong btw, I just leave it there for historical reasons. It assumes only movements in R B are valid.
