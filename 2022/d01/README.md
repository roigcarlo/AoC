## Featuring... Calorie Counting! ##

This year we are featuring [*Rust and Steam*](https://www.amazon.com.au/Rust-Steam-Anne-Renwick/dp/1948359111), by Anne Renwick. 

Why? May you ask, my dear coder. Because I use **Rust**, and elves gathering fruits are not **Steamy** enough to move my cogs and gears ;)

I am sure that reading this book would have made the elves burn much more calories...
