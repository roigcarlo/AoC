⚙️ My solutions for AoC-2022

⚙️ Carefuly written alongside the warm of a cozy fireplace in winter.

⚙️ Real programmers use only RUST (I'm gonna regret this.)

## Build

```bash
$ cargo build -r
```

## Run

The `xx` indicates that you must put a number between 01 and 25, for example `d01`. If you put something that is not a number, for example `dIDDQD`, it will **not** work

```bash
$ cargo run -r --bin d[xx]
```

## Enjoy

And read a good book
