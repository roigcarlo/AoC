# Hydrothermal Venture #

## Featuring... Kowalsky Himself! ##

It is relatively straight forward to make code art with languages like C++, java, dart (haha pun intended, because D-ART, you get it? Ok I stop).But is not so easy to do with python. 

For this particular case it's just enough to replace the language delimiters with some tokens and then evaluate the code replacing them back.

And of course you need to have a good sense of proportions...
