## Featuring... Generative functions! ##

Ok this one is still under development. 

I remember from my days at the campus that there was that thing called Generative function that basically could be use to convert a recursive expression into a closed expression.

Since the recurrence of this problem can be calculated as:

```
f(x) = f(x-7) + f(x-9) + 1
```

It should technically be possible to calculate this directly.
